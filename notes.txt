Branches currently:
Master 
	overhaulForSymbolicEvaluation (created Algebraic -Term and -Expression cls)
		incorporateAlgebraIntoPolynomial (incorporated them into Polynomial)
so how is this second feature branch going to work?
	Basically. i just set all the coefficients in the PolynomialTerm class
	to algebraicEpressions. 
	I have already implemented the logic for their evaluation
	I dont think I will have to mess with the PolynomialClass unless maybe with
	the __repr__
Now I have done this already. I am just having a little problem with
AlgebraicTerms that occur last in an algebraicExpression when i evaluate
a derivative

Now i have designed the algebraicEpression constructor to take AlgebraicTerms as argument
so wherever I can pass an algebraicTerm instead of an algebraic_string, I should do so.
I have solved the problem with the last term in al algebraicExpression
